# Heart Disease Classification
Completed data mining classification projects using Python. 
A dataset was pulled from UCI Machine Learning Repository [1]. The data was taken from 303 patients from a Cleveland Medical Centre, 137 of which have some form of heart disease rated on a scale from one to four, with zero representing no presence. The data set contains 14 medically related attributes used to predict the presence of heart disease.
Used classifiers such as: K nearesrt Neighbours, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Support vector machine using Sklearn packages. 
Used Pandas package to pre-process data.
